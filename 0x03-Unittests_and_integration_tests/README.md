# Unittests and Integration Tests
This is a project that explains unit testing for standard inputs and corner cases and integration testing for low level functions that make external calls such as HTTP requests, file I/O, database I/O, etc. This is part of the **Software Engineering** program at **ALX**.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* The difference between unit and integration tests.
* Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures

## Requirements
* All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* There is a `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* All code used the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
* All files are executable
* The length of all files are tested using `wc`
* All modules have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All classes have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All functions (inside and outside a class) have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)

## Required Files
* `utils.py` (https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/webstack/utils.py)
* `client.py` (https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/webstack/client.py)
* `fixtures.py` (https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/webstack/fixtures.py)
