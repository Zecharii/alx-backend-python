# Python - Async
This project is part of the short specializations course of the Software Engineering programme at ALX. It aims to teach u s about Asynchronous IO in Python.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, we are expected to be know:
- `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create `asyncio` tasks
- How to use the `random` module

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7)
- All files are executable
- All code used the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x)
- All functions and coroutines are type-annotated
- All modules and functions have complete sentence documentation

## Tasks
| Files | Description |
| `0-basic_async_syntax.py` | asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument |
| `1-concurrent_coroutines.py` | async routine called that takes in 2 int arguments |
| 2-measure_runtime.py` | function that measures the total execution time | 
| 3-tasks.py` | regular function syntax that takes an integer |
| `4-tasks.py` | altered async routine that takes two arguments |
