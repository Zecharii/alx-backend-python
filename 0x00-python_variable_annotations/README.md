# Python - Variable Annotations
This course is aimed to teach us about Python annotations and how to use them.

## Technologies
* All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version `3.7`)
* All code should used the `pycodestyl`e style (version `2.5.`)
* All modules, classes, methods, and functions have documentation

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, we are expected to be know:
* Type annotations in Python 3
* How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
* Duck typing
* How to validate your code with `mypy`
